By an amazing coincidence, it was consonant with the term \\\"folklore\\\", the subject of the band's activity.\",\n\t\t\t\"text2\": \"The band was founded in Kyiv, Ukraine, by Volodymyr Muliar and Yaryna Kvitka in 2009. Before, Volodymyr played drums in several rock bands in his hometown of Khmelnytsky and Yaryna (originally from Stryi, Lviv region) was engaged in folk singing at the Kyiv ethno-band \\\"Rozhanytsia\\\". After meeting in 2008, both shared an interest in cycling trips and folk music. In 2009 in a joint cycling trip to Abkhazia the couple performed publicly for the first time on the streets of several cities. Soon, Volodymyr and Yaryna recorded together their own version of Ukrainian folk song \\\"Da zyma nasha biela\\\" and began to seek actively musicians to supplement the group.\",\n\t\t\t\"text3\": \"At the beginning of 2010 the group joined vocalist Yulia Sovershenna also a member of the group \\\"Rozhanytsia\\\" and while some time Folknery were working as three members. At that time was formed the musical style of the band – a mix of authentic Ukrainian singing in free-folk arrangement involving elements of different trends of the world folk and popular music, as well as unusual musical instruments: hurdy gurdy, African Djembe and others. This line-up recorded the song \\\"Vyplyvalo utenya\\\" and the first music video (directed by Oksana Kazmina, cameraman Maxim Hutsu). The video was presented at the festival \\\"Trypilske Kolo\\\" 2010.\",\n\t\t\t\"text4\": \"In 2011 Folknery began a concert activity with increased line-up: accordionist Ostap Danyliv and percussionist Roman Sharkevych joined the band.

Besides the 1st prize, band also won the \\\"Audience Award\\\".\\n In 2012 Ostap Danyliv was replaced by Iryna Viryasova, Roman Sharkevych left the band and Dmytro Sorokin joined as the guitarist. In early 2013 the band presented the new video for the song \\\"Rozova – byeryozova\\\" (directed by Maryna Hryshai, cameraman Maksym Zaika), which won the film festival \\\"Vision\\\" (Kemerovo,

До того Володимир грав на ударних в кількох рок-гуртах у рідному місті Хмельницькому. Ярина (родом зі Стрия Львівської обл.) займалася народним співом у київському етно-гурті \\\"Рожаниця\\\". Після знайомства у 2008 році обоє розділили інтерес до веломандрівок та народної музики. Під час спільної велоподорожі до Абхазії 2009 року пара вперше публічно виступала на вулицях російських та абхазьких міст. Незабаром Володимир та Ярина удвох записали власні версії кількох українських народних пісень і розпочали пошук музикантів для поповнення гурту.\",\n\t\t\t\"text3\": \"На початку 2010 року до гурту приєдналася вокалістка Юлія Совершенна, також учасниця колективу \\\"Рожаниця\\\" і деякий час Фолькнери працювали утрьох. На цей час сформувався і музичний стиль гурту – суміш українського автентичного співу з фрі-фолковим аранжуванням із залученням елементів різноманітних напрямів світової народної та популярної музики, а також неординарних музичних інструментів: колісної ліри, африканського джембе та ін. Цим складом музиканти записали пісню \\\"Випливало утєня\\\", на яку зняли перший кліп (режисер Оксана Казьміна, оператор Максим Гуцу). Дана відеоробота презентувалася на фестивалі \\\"Трипільське коло\\\" 2010 р.\",\n\t\t\t\"text4\": \"У 2011 році Фолькнери почали активну концертну діяльність зі збільшеним складом і з того часу виступали на відомих фестивалях в Україні та за кордоном: \\\"АртПоле\\\", \\\"Країна Мрій\\\", \\\"Трипільське коло\\\", \\\"Terra Heroica\\\", \\\"Рожаниця\\\", \\\"Трипільські зорі\\\", \\\"Рок-Коляда\\\",\\\"Млиноманія\\\", \\\"Черемош-фест\\\"; \\\"Mikołajki Folkowe\\\", \\\"Sabałowe Bajania\\\", \\\"Letnija Akademija Filmowa w Zwierzyńcu\\\", \\\"Muzyczne Dialogi nad Bugiem\\\", \\\"Jarmark Jagelonski\\\" (Польща); \\\"Mėnuo Juodaragis\\\" (Литва); \\\"Камяница\\\" (Білорусь).\",\n\t\t\t\"text5\": \"У грудні 2011 року Фолькнери стали кращим етно-колективом року на міжнародному фестивалі-конкурсі \\\"Mikołajki Folkowe\\\" в Любліні (Польща).

Before, Volodymyr played drums in several rock bands in his hometown of Khmelnytsky and Yaryna (originally from Stryi, Lviv region) was engaged in folk singing at the Kyiv ethno-band \\\"Rozhanytsia\\\". After meeting in 2008, both shared an interest in cycling trips and folk music. In 2009 in a joint cycling trip to Abkhazia the couple performed publicly for the first time on the streets of several cities. Soon, Volodymyr and Yaryna recorded together their own version of Ukrainian folk song \\\"Da zyma nasha biela\\\" and began to seek actively musicians to supplement the group.\",\n\t\t\"text3\": \"At the beginning of 2010 the group joined vocalist Yulia Sovershenna also a member of the group \\\"Rozhanytsia\\\" and while some time Folknery were working as three members. At that time was formed the musical style of the band – a mix of authentic Ukrainian singing in free-folk arrangement involving elements of different trends of the world folk and popular music, as well as unusual musical instruments: hurdy gurdy, African Djembe and others. This line-up recorded the song \\\"Vyplyvalo utenya\\\" and the first music video (directed by Oksana Kazmina, cameraman Maxim Hutsu). The video was presented at the festival \\\"Trypilske Kolo\\\" 2010.\",\n\t\t\"text4\": \"In 2011 Folknery began a concert activity with increased line-up: accordionist Ostap Danyliv and percussionist Roman Sharkevych joined the band.
